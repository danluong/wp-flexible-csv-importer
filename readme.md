## Description 


### Features 

Frustrated that only the paid plugins would handle my various CSV files with different fields, I decided to write this plugin vs using a throwaway import script. Hopefully this will help others facing the same problem.

Simple flow-based approach:

 * upload your CSV
 * check/adjust data will be imported how you imagine
 * auto-generate WordPress content from your imported data

It shouldn't need to be much harder than that. 

Developed by [**Leon Stafford**](http://leonstafford.github.io). If you have any questions about this plugin's usage, installation or development, please email me at: [leon.stafford@mac.com](mailto:leon.stafford@mac.com)

This plugin does not phone-home or solicit you to pay for more features. By the people, for the people!

## Frequently Asked Questions

I made it to fulfil a need I had, which other plugins wouldn't do (or wanted $$ to do so!). I maintain it to help others and by doing so, I might occasionally get paid dev work.
